My changes to the code are supposed to add extensability, 
improve readability, and improve the documentation.

As for improving extensibility, my code should make it easy 
for users to create new AI agents by making so that they only 
have to change one line of exisiting code. I plan to modify 
the code to accomplish this by separating the AI agents into 
reusable code classes, this way the agent can be changed easily. 
I will also modify the code so that there is only one line in 
GameRunner.ts that should be changed by the user for their
additions.

For improving readability, my code should clean up the 
existing code by adding abstraction and changing names. I plan
to modify the code to abstract out some repeated methods
and to change names that don't make a lot of sense to names 
that clearly show what the variables contain or what the 
functions do.

Finally, the code has some comments, but my code should add 
comments that would help users understand what is going and 
and what they need to do. I plan to modify the code to add 
comments that show the user how to extend the code by creating
a new agent and how to change the agent that controls a player.
